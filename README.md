## My Contributions
As a contributor to the Recipe Rover project, I was responsible for developing the entire front-end portion of the application. This included:
- Designing a user-friendly interface ensuring seamless user experience.
- Integrating the front-end with back-end services to fetch and display recipes.

Additionally, I contributed to the development of several back-end features, including:
- The creation and management of recipe endpoints.
- Assisting with database schema design for recipe storage.

My work on this project aimed to create an intuitive and efficient platform for users to manage their recipes with ease.
